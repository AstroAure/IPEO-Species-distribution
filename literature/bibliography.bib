  abstract      = {The difficulty of monitoring biodiversity at fine scales and over large areas limits ecological knowledge and conservation efforts. To fill this gap, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) predict species across space from spatially explicit features. Yet, they face the challenge of integrating the rich but heterogeneous data made available over the past decade, notably millions of opportunistic species observations and standardized surveys, as well as multimodal remote sensing data. In light of that, we have designed and developed a new European-scale dataset for SDMs at high spatial resolution (10--50m), including more than 10k species (i.e., most of the European flora). The dataset comprises 5M heterogeneous Presence-Only records and 90k exhaustive Presence-Absence survey records, all accompanied by diverse environmental rasters (e.g., elevation, human footprint, and soil) traditionally used in SDMs. In addition, it provides Sentinel-2 RGB and NIR satellite images with 10 m resolution, a 20-year time series of climatic variables, and satellite time series from the Landsat program. In addition to the data, we provide an openly accessible SDM benchmark (hosted on Kaggle), which has already attracted an active community and a set of strong baselines for single predictor/modality and multimodal approaches. All resources, e.g., the dataset, pre-trained models, and baseline methods (in the form of notebooks), are available on Kaggle, allowing one to start with our dataset literally with two mouse clicks.},

  abstract      = {Species distribution models (SDMs) aim to predict the distribution of species by relating occurrence data with environmental variables. Recent applications of deep learning to SDMs have enabled new avenues, specifically the inclusion of spatial data (environmental rasters, satellite images) as model predictors, allowing the model to consider the spatial context around each species' observations. However, the appropriate spatial extent of the images is not straightforward to determine and may affect the performance of the model, as scale is recognized as an important factor in SDMs. We develop a modular structure for SDMs that allows us to test the effect of scale in both single- and multi-scale settings. Furthermore, our model enables different scales to be considered for different modalities, using a late fusion approach. Results on the GeoLifeCLEF 2023 benchmark indicate that considering multimodal data and learning multi-scale representations leads to more accurate models.},
